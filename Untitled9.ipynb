        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Memory Efficiency\n",
        "Generators produce values lazily, i.e., one at a time and only when requested, rather than computing and storing the entire result set at once. This is particularly useful when dealing with large data sets or sequences, as it avoids loading the entire data set into memory.\n",
        "In contrast, regular functions that return large collections (like lists or dictionaries) create and store all values in memory at once, which can lead to memory overload when dealing with large data. Lazy Evaluation: Generators compute values on-the-fly, meaning they only generate values as needed. This can improve performance and responsiveness in applications where not all data is needed immediately.\n",
        "Simplified Code: Generators can simplify code by allowing you to create iterators without needing to implement the iterator protocol. This can lead to cleaner and more readable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "State Retention: Generators maintain their state between calls. When a generator function is paused, it retains its local variables, which allows for complex stateful iterations without the overhead of an entire class or structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Infinite Sequences: Generators can represent infinite sequences (like generating Fibonacci numbers) without running into memory issues, as they only compute the next value when requested.\n",
        "\n",
        "Easier to Work with Streams: Generators are well-suited for working with streams of data, such as reading lines from a file or processing incoming data in real-time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improved Performance in Some Cases: Since generators yield items one at a time, they can be more efficient in certain scenarios where the entire dataset doesn't need to be processed at once."

        "Purpose of the map() Function in Python: The map() function in Python is used to apply a given function to all items in an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or set) and return a new iterable (usually a map object, which can be converted into a list, tuple, etc.). It allows for functional-style programming, where you can apply a function to every element of a collection without explicitly writing loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "The function passed to map() is applied to each element of the iterable.\n",
        "It returns a map object, which is an iterator. You can convert it to a list, tuple, or other sequence types if needed.\n",
        "Multiple iterables can be passed, in which case the function should accept that many arguments, and map() will apply the function element-wise across the iterables."

        "In Python, map(), reduce(), and filter() are functional programming tools that allow you to apply functions to iterables.
